This project focused on improving the existing user interface, implementing a cohesive design system, and refining the Tiber branding to enhance overall user experience. The redesign aimed to address usability issues, establish visual consistency, and create a more intuitive workflow for users interacting with complex AI operations.

### Main Issues
**Technical complexity:**
The Tiber AI Cloud platform handles complex AI workflows that needed to be presented in an intuitive way without oversimplification.

**Diverse user base:**
The platform serves multiple user personas with varying technical expertise, from students to data scientists and IT administrators.

**Design inconsistency:**
The existing UI had evolved organically from an MVP, resulting in inconsistent patterns, components, and interactions.

**Brand identity:**
Balancing Intel's corporate identity guidelines with the need for the Tiber portfolio brand to have its own distinct visual language.
