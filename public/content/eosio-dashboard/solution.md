I designed and developed the EOSIO Dashboard, a comprehensive analytics platform that provides real-time insights into the EOSIO blockchain network. The dashboard integrates data from multiple sources including chain APIs, block explorers, and resource pricing oracles to create a unified view of network activity.

The solution features a modular architecture with specialized components for different aspects of the blockchain:

- **Network Overview**: Real-time metrics on block production, transaction volume, and network congestion
- **Resource Monitor**: Interactive charts tracking CPU, NET, and RAM usage and costs
- **Account Analytics**: Detailed analysis of account activity, resource allocation, and token balances
- **Block Explorer Integration**: Seamless connection to detailed transaction data
- **Customizable Alerts**: Notification system for important network events and threshold breaches

The dashboard employs responsive design principles to ensure usability across devices, with optimized data loading patterns to maintain performance even when displaying large datasets.
