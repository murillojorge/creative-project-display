Our research approach was comprehensive and continuous throughout the project, leveraging multiple research methodologies:

**Direct user interviews:** The product team conducted in-depth interviews with partners and users across different segments (students, researchers, developers) to gather qualitative feedback on pain points, expectations, and feature priorities.

**Competitive analysis:** At all project stages, we performed thorough comparative analysis of our user journeys against industry leaders in cloud platforms and cloud services. This helped identify best practices, common patterns, and opportunities for differentiation.

**Usage metrics analysis:** We tracked and analyzed platform metrics to identify user engagement patterns, drop-off points in critical workflows, and underutilized features that needed better visibility or redesign.

**Heuristic evaluation:** Conducted expert reviews of the existing interface against established usability principles to identify immediate improvement opportunities.

**Technical feasibility sessions:** Regular workshops with engineering teams to ensure design proposals were technically feasible within our Bootstrap framework and performance requirements.
