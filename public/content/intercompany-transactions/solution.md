#### Authentication

At its heart InterX is a blockchain application, and as such it makes use of external wallets containing private keys that identify its users. Since one of our main goals was to speed up the processes, it mades no sense to force our users learn about new ways of doing things. So from the UX side we fought to keep it simple and use the company providers authentication methods.​​​​​​​​​​​​​​
#### Constant Communication

One of the aspects brought to our attention early on during interviews, was the fact that constant communication is needed in order to successfully understand and bring a transaction to completion. It felt natural to include a comment section per transaction.

#### Approvals Flow

Designing a component that would help users understand clearly and easily what is happening at any given time during the process is central to the solution. Complimentary to this component related data must be present at hand in order to help the user proceed with further validations or approvals.

#### Visual System

Material design is an extremely robust and documented design system and its MUI kit was an invaluable tool to help InterX user interface come to fruition and go into development in a very timely manner. Color and typography was selected based on the client brand book.​​​​​​​
