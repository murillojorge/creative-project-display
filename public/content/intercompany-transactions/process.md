Implemented using enterprise-grade technologies with focus on security, compliance, and scalability.

### User Research

#### Personas

Initial insight and expertise from the client helped us develop a set of five user personas that represent the involvement of counterparts needed for every specific intercompany transaction we were set up to build during our first three minimum viable products.
We spend time interviewing company staff that had to handle this specific transactions to validate our personas and hone into their frustrations and expectations on how to solve the problem. This also helped us figure which channels and devices the users would be using during different stages of the transaction flow.

#### Journey Mapping

Below you can find a sample set of many of the possible transaction type interactions that InterX would be able to handle. These mappings helped us point out user experience pitfalls during the flow of the transactions and thus create features that help out not only to accomplish their tasks at hand but also keep them informed of the next steps and whoâ€™s responsible.

#### User Flows

Based on the opportunities found during journey mapping we developed a set of user flows. This would help us understand the structure of the front end and general sitemap for the app.
