Our research revealed several critical insights that guided our design approach:

### Design Approach
**Intuitive patterns for experts**
Expert users found our main interaction patterns intuitive and often easier to follow than those of leading cloud platforms in the industry. This was a strength we needed to preserve while making other improvements.

**Scaling complexity challenge** As our product offerings expanded, we identified a critical need to carefully structure and present our growing services and products to avoid overwhelming users with choices and complexity.

**Onboarding gap for beginners**
Students and beginner users required a much clearer onboarding experience to effectively access the computational and experimental power of our platform. The existing entry points were optimized for experts but created barriers for newcomers.

**Feature discovery issues**
Usage metrics revealed that many valuable platform capabilities remained undiscovered by users, indicating a need for better navigation and feature highlighting.

**Consistent mental models**
Users who successfully adopted the platform developed specific mental models of how AI workflows should function, which differed between academic and professional contexts but showed consistent patterns within each group.
