In 2021, the demand for blockchain innovation reached unprecedented levels. The EOSIO Hackathon, hosted in partnership with Google Cloud, Galaxy Interactive, and Mythical Games, presented a unique opportunity to leverage blockchain technology for social good. Participants were challenged to build EOSIO-based applications that could bring significant positive change to communities worldwide by combining blockchain capabilities with scalable Google Cloud infrastructure. Digital creators were eager to contribute to charitable causes but lacked a dedicated platform that could connect their work with meaningful impact while ensuring transparency and trust.

### Problems Identified
- No dedicated platform for charitable digital goods
- Lack of transparency in fund distribution
- Limited creator-charity connections
