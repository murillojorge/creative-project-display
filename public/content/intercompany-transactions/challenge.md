InterX is a blockchain supported web app, designed and developed to help big companies untangle the complexity and time consumption while processing intercompany transactions.

This application was designed and developed with Grant Thornton's USA Innovation Department

### Enterprise Challenges
1. Help speed up the process time for intercompany transactions.
2. Provide a central point of information with traceable and immutable data.

### Problem Statement
Corporations and big companies have a very fragmented and inefficient way of processing intercompany transactions. Most of the processes are being handled through email and Excel documents. Even though things “get done” in the end, there’s a set of issues that arise during the process, making it difficult for auditors and validators to find data and make sure it’s trustworthy. There’s also an added cost to the process that comes from not being able to perform settlements timely and uniformly.
